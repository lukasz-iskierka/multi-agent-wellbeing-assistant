    "# 🧠 Multi-Agent Wellbeing Assistant\n",
    "\n",
    "An autonomous research assistant designed to produce a **personalised wellbeing action plan** in response to a problem reported by a user.  \n",
    "At its core, this LLM-based agentic system generates a set of **customised steps** that users can take to improve their wellbeing, outputting them as a comprehensive report.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** The system’s output should be viewed as a personalised wellbeing blog, **not medical advice**. It is intended for **guidance only**.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "- Multi-agent architecture and workflow orchestration with **LangChain / LangGraph**\n",
    "- **Chat model:** GPT-4o (OpenAI)\n",
    "- **Pydantic-based schemas** for model adherence\n",
    "- **Tavily API** integration for web search\n",
    "- **WikipediaLoader** from the LangChain community\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core design concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "- Planning module\n",
    "- ReAct and Chain-of-Thought frameworks\n",
    "- Human-in-the-Loop\n",
    "- LLM-powered knowledge curation inspired with Stanford's **STORM**  \n",
    "- Parellel execution\n",
    "- Map-reduce pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "## Detailed design\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. User Input**\n",
    "\n",
    "A user describes the problem they are facing and specifies the number of steps they would like their wellbeing action plan to include.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example input:**  \n",
    "> “I’m feeling very stressed at work because I don’t like being surrounded by many people in my open office.”\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Planning Stage**\n",
    "\n",
    "After receiving the user’s problem, the system generates the specified number of steps, each containing a domain (theme) and a helpful tip.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example output:**\n",
    "\n",
    "`- Step -`\n",
    "\n",
    "***`Theme:`*** `Workplace adjustments`  \n",
    "\n",
    "***`Helpful tip:`*** `Consider discussing with your manager the possibility of creating a more private workspace, such as using partitions or screens, to help reduce the feeling of being surrounded by many people. Additionally, explore flexible work hours to avoid peak office times, which may further alleviate stress.`\n",
    "\n",
    "- The plan is generated within a **sub-graph** that maintains its own state, employing the **ReAct** and **Chain-of-Thought** frameworks.  \n",
    "- A **human-in-the-loop** process allows users to review and suggest changes before deeper research begins.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Consultation Stage**\n",
    "\n",
    "This **LLM-powered knowledge curation** process is inspired by Stanford’s [STORM](https://github.com/stanford-oval/storm).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simulated Conversation:** One agent acts as a *client* attending a wellbeing consultation, while another plays the role of a *practitioner* whose knowledge is grounded in web and Wikipedia sources.  \n",
    "- **Perspective-Guided Question Asking:** The client’s questions are guided by their (user) problem, initial wellbeing plan and the practitioner’s evolving responses.  \n",
    "- This multi-turn dialogue serves as a mechanism for identifying and retrieving relevant source documents (web/Wiki).  \n",
    "- Consultations are executed **in parallel** across multiple sub-graphs using a **map-reduce** pattern.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Final Plan Generation**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Source documents and consultation transcripts are synthesized into a **final wellbeing action plan**.  \n",
    "- References to the consulted sources are included.  \n",
    "- The **format of the final plan** is customisable.  \n",

The origins to its conception and creation can be traced back to the traditional approaches from East Asian formative and functional medicine, philosophy and spirituality, birthed from the basic underlying tenets from classical Taoist, Buddhist and Traditional Chinese medical texts, doctrine and teachings.\\nRecently, mindfulness therapy has become of great interest to the scientific and medical community in the West, leading to the development of many new innovative approaches to preventative and treatment strategies to physical and mental health conditions and care. One such approach is the relapse-prevention for individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD). A focus on MDD and attention to negative thought processes such as false beliefs and rumination, distinguishes MBCT from other mindfulness-based therapies. Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), for example, is a more generalized program that also utilizes the practice of mindfulness. MBSR is a group-intervention program, like MBCT, that uses mindfulness to help improve the lives of individuals with chronic clinical ailments and high-stress.\\nCBT-inspired methods are used in MBCT, such as educating the participant about depression and the role that cognition plays within it. MBCT takes practices from CBT and applies aspects of mindfulness to the approach. One example would be \"decentering\", a focus on becoming aware of all incoming thoughts and feelings and accepting them, but not attaching or reacting to them. This process aims to aid an individual in disengaging from self-criticism, rumination, and dysphoric moods that can arise when reacting to negative thinking patterns.\\nLike CBT, MBCT functions on the etiological theory that when individuals who have historically had depression become distressed, they return to automatic cognitive processes that can trigger a depressive episode. The goal of MBCT is to interrupt these automatic processes and teach the participants to focus less on reacting to incoming stimuli, and instead accepting and observing them without judgment. Like MBSR, this mindfulness practice encourages the participant to notice when automatic processes are occurring and to alter their reaction to be more of a reflection. With regard to development, MBCT emphasizes awareness of thoughts, which helps individuals recognize negative thoughts that lead to rumination. It is theorized that this aspect of MBCT is responsible for the observed clinical outcomes.\\nBeyond the use of MBCT to reduce depressive symptoms, a meta-analysis done by Chiesa and Serretti (2014) supports the effectiveness of mindfulness meditation in reducing cravings for individuals with substance abuse issues. Addiction is known to involve interference with the prefrontal cortex, which ordinarily allows for delaying of immediate gratification for longer-term benefits by the limbic and paralimbic brain regions. The nucleus accumbens, together with the ventral tegmental area, constitutes the central link in the reward circuit. The nucleus accumbens is also one of the brain structures that is most closely involved in drug dependency. In an experiment with smokers, mindfulness meditation practiced over a two-week period totaling five hours of meditation decreased smoking by about 60% an\\n</Document>\\n\\n<Document source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive%E2%80%93behavioral_therapies, title: \"List of cognitive–behavioral therapies\"/>\\nCognitive behavioral therapy encompasses many therapeutical approaches, techniques and systems.\\n\\nAcceptance and commitment therapy was developed by Steven C.

American psychologist Kristin Neff has defined self-compassion as being composed of three main elements  – self-kindness, common humanity, and mindfulness.\\n\\nSelf-kindness: Self-compassion entails being warm towards oneself when encountering pain and personal shortcomings, rather than ignoring them or hurting oneself with self-criticism.\\nCommon humanity: Self-compassion also involves recognizing that suffering and personal failure is part of the shared human experience rather than isolating.\\nMindfulness: Self-compassion requires taking a balanced approach to one\\'s negative emotions so that feelings are neither suppressed nor exaggerated.  Negative thoughts and emotions are observed with openness, so that they are held in mindful awareness. Mindfulness is a non-judgmental, receptive mind state in which individuals observe their thoughts and feelings as they are, without trying to suppress or deny them.  Conversely, mindfulness requires that one not be \"over-identified\" with mental or emotional phenomena, so that one suffers aversive reactions.  This latter type of response involves narrowly focusing and ruminating on one\\'s negative emotions.\\nSelf-compassion in some ways resembles Carl Rogers\\' notion of \"unconditional positive regard\" applied both towards clients and oneself; Albert Ellis\\' \"unconditional self-acceptance\"; Maryhelen Snyder\\'s notion of an \"internal empathizer\" that explored one\\'s own experience with \"curiosity and compassion\"; Ann Weiser Cornell\\'s notion of a gentle, allowing relationship with all parts of one\\'s being; and Judith Jordan\\'s concept of self-empathy, which implies acceptance, care and empathy towards the self.\\nSelf-compassion is different from self-pity, a state of mind or emotional response of a person believing to be a victim and lacking the confidence and competence to cope with an adverse situation.\\nResearch indicates that self-compassionate individuals experience greater psychological health than those who lack self-compassion.  For example, self-compassion is positively associated with life satisfaction, wisdom, happiness, optimism, curiosity, learning goals, social connectedness, personal responsibility, and emotional resilience.  At the same time, it is associated with a lower tendency for self-criticism, depression, anxiety, rumination, thought suppression, perfectionism, and disordered eating attitudes. Studies show that compassion can also be a useful variable in understanding mental health and resilience.\\nSelf-compassion has different effects than self-esteem, a subjective emotional evaluation of the self. Although psychologists extolled the benefits of self-esteem for many years, recent research has exposed costs associated with the pursuit of high self-esteem, including narcissism, distorted self-perceptions, contingent and/or unstable self-worth, as well as anger and violence toward those who threaten the ego. As self-esteem is often associated with perceived self-worth in externalised domains such as appearance, academics and social approval, it is often unstable and susceptible to negative outcomes. In comparison, it appears that self-compassion offers the same mental health benefits as self-esteem, but with fewer of its drawbacks such as narcissism, ego-defensive anger, inaccurate self-perceptions, self-worth contingency, or social comparison.\\n\\n\\n== Scales ==\\n\\n</Document>']}}\n",
